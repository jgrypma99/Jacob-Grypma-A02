Event Driven System - Unique Upgrade System For a 2D RPG

Players build words from provided glyphs > Words can be strung together into sequences called prayers > each word in the prayer provides beneficial effects to the player such as giving a new ability or increasing stats

Design Rationale
The idea behind this concept was to create a unique upgrade system to replace the typical level up system in a 2D RPG that allows for a high level of customization and emergent gameplay. By building a string of words, 
each with their own unique effect, players can easily tailor their build to suit their desired playstyle.

Design Challenges
Probably the biggest challenge I faced was transliteration between the latin alphabet and the celestial glyphs I used. The glyphs are based on a real-life occult alphabet created in the 16th century using the hebrew
alphabet as a bsais, as such there is an inconsitency between the number of glyphs and the number of letters in the alphabet. Although I like this from a challenge standpoint, in that it requires players to use their head
to figure out the proper transliteration, it would be neccessary to include a porper legend in the final game explaining each glyph and its corresponding latin transliteration.

Changes I would make
A few things I'd like to change about the system would be to change the display of words in the prayer from latin text to the celestial version. Change glyphs so that they're a limited resource players would hace to collect
rather than just an infinte resource like they are now (for example if the player wanted to use multiple words that contain the "Aleph" glyph, they would have to ensure that they have the required amount of Aleph glyphs.)
In the final game there would be a way for players to acquire more word slots so they could eventually string together a prayer of 10 words.
